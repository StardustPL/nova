PolyStatic
==========
A new programming language that is combination scripted and compiled (sort of like Python) with Object Oriented goals but none of the horrid design patterns, idioms, etc. that have to be created for other languages.

It is meant to be used as modular logic for games, e.g. it is intentionally designed with both object-oriented game design and user/community modifications in mind.
